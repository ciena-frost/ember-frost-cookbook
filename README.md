# ember-frost-cookbook
*A collection of recipes to get you cooking in Ember*

The intent of this cookbook is to provide example reicpes showing how to accomplish different tasks in Ember. The initial recipes are focused on how to write different types of tests but the scope is not limited to just testing concerns.
